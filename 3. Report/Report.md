# Report on Global Electrical Energy Consumption Analysis

## Introduction
In this report, it is presented a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption trends and patterns based on the provided dataset taken from KAGGLE. The analysis encompasses various aspects, including yearly consumption, regional variations, consumption ratios, losses, and global perspectives.<br>
<br>
The following sections provide a detailed explanation for the report.

## 1. Yearly Consumption Trend

The graph above illustrates the yearly global energy consumption trend. The data reveals a linear increase trend of the electrical energy consumption in the world from 1980 to 2021, not considering two interesting periods (2009 and 2020). <br>
Firstly, in 2009 we can observe a decrease in consumption from the past year, which is interesting. Acording to other researches, this decrease in consumption was caused by recession that happened during this period. Recession was a sharp decline in economic activity from 2007-2009, that affected the energy consumption as well. <br>
2020 was the pandemic period. During the lockdown (i.e. limited restrictions, partial lockdown or full lockdown), curtailment in many activities, e.g. mobility, economic activity, construction and manufacturing, dropped the global energy demand, all acros the world.

## 2. Yearly Consumption by Regions

Furthermore, the second graph breaks down energy consumption by regions. Each color corresponds to a specific geographic area, providing insights into regional disparities in energy usage. From the figure, we can observe that "Asia & Oceania"'s consumption increased rapidly from around 2003. This increase, indicates the well known rapid increase in the industry in this region.

## 3. Consumption Ratio Change

To look the "Asia & Oceania" rapid increase in the overall electrical energy consumption, the above chart is shown. This figure focuses on the consumption ratio comparison, highlighting the proportion of energy derived from different regions. In the left part of the figure, it is shown the energy consumption ratio based on region for 1980, and similarly in the right part the same chart for 2021 year. The figure shows the drastic increase of "Asia & Oceania" consumption ratio, changing from **15.9%** of world consumption to **50%** of the world consumption.

## 4. Yearly Consumption Ratio Trends

Building on the previous analysis from the 1st section, the above graph extends the understanding of consumption trend over the years for different regions. Again, clearly it is shown that **"Asia & Oceania"** consumption increase shifted rapidly, affecting the overall global consumption as well. A big increase, it is observed in **"Middle East"** region as well. Other regions had increase in energy consumption as well, excluding "Euroasia" whi in the 2000s had a decrease consumption.

## 5. Yearly Energy Losses

The fifth graph delves into energy losses, offering insights into the efficiency of energy transmission and distribution systems. Understanding these losses is essential for optimizing energy infrastructure and reducing overall energy waste. <br>
The graph, is plotted in log scale in order to compare losses and consumption or generation in a more narrow scale. From the graph, it is observed that in 2010s, the overall losses are decreased, even though that the world consumption increased. This indicates the increase in efficiency in energy transmission and distribution system.

## 6. Global Energy Consumption

In the above figure, in this section it is shown a choropleth map of global energy consumption in kWh in 2021. China, United States, India, Russia and Japan lead in energy consumption in the world. 

## 7. Global Energy Consumption Per Person

</div>

In this graph, it is analyzed the energy consumption on a per-person basis globally. This metric is crucial for assessing the equitable distribution of energy resources and identifying regions with high energy consumption. From the graph, it is observed that acandinavian countries lead in energy consumption per person, followed by Qatar and Kuwait. The Nordic countries have a large energy-intensive manufacturing sector, and electricity is much more widely used to heat buildings and water than in other parts of the world.

## 8. Global Energy Generation Per Person

<div style="text-align:center;">

</div>

The eighth and final graph explores the per-person energy generation globally. Similarly with energy consumption, Iceland and Norway lead in the most energy generated per person, followed by by Qatar and Kuwait. Canada also has a high energy generation per person, which is a big provider of the electricity in United States.

## Conclusion

This analysis of global energy consumption trends provides valuable insights into the dynamics that have shaped the world's energy landscape over the past four decades. From the linear rise in global energy consumption, interrupted notably by the economic recession of 2009 and the unprecedented global lockdown in 2020, to the regional shifts in consumption patterns, this report sheds light on critical factors influencing energy demand.

The breakdown of yearly consumption by regions underscores the remarkable surge in "Asia & Oceania," signaling the rapid industrialization in the region. The detailed examination of consumption ratios reveals a transformative change, with "Asia & Oceania" catapulting from 15.9% to a commanding 50% of global energy consumption.

Exploring yearly consumption ratio trends further elucidates the impact of these shifts, emphasizing the role of "Asia & Oceania" and the "Middle East" in driving the overall global consumption trends. Noteworthy is the commendable increase in energy efficiency, evident in the decreasing losses even as global consumption rises, suggesting advancements in energy transmission and distribution systems.

The global perspective is enriched through a choropleth map of energy consumption and an examination of per-person energy consumption and generation. China, the United States, India, Russia, and Japan emerge as leading consumers, while Scandinavian countries, Qatar, Kuwait lead in per-person consumption and generation.
