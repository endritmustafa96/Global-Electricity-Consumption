## Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of global electrical energy consumption using a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akhiljethwa/global-electricity-statistics <br>
The project is organized into four main directories: 0. Data, 1. Notebook, 2. Preprocessed data, and 3. Report.

### 0. Data
In this directory, the downloaded dataset from Kaggle can be founded in a .zip file.

### 1. Notebook
The Notebook directory contains a Jupyter Notebook <code>Global_Electricity_Consumption.ipynb</code> that comprehensively addresses various aspects of the dataset. The notebook covers data loading, cleaning, transformation, and detailed analysis of energy consumption trends. It provides insights into yearly consumption trends, regional disparities, consumption ratios, losses, and global perspectives.

### 2. Preprocessed data
The Preprocessed data directory stores CSV files containing the preprocessed and transformed data from <code>Global_Electricity_Consumption.ipynb</code>. These files are generated during the data cleaning and transformation process in the notebook and serve as valuable resources for anyone looking to explore the dataset without going through the entire preprocessing pipeline.

### 3. Report
The Report directory contains a detailed report <code>Energy_consumption_report.md</code> summarizing the analyses and findings from the project. The report is organized into sections, each corresponding to a specific aspect of the analysis. It includes visualizations, graphs, and insights derived from the dataset, providing a comprehensive overview of global energy consumption trends.

## How to Use
Notebook: Open and run the Jupyter Notebook <code>Global_Electricity_Consumption.ipynb</code> in the Notebook directory. This will guide you through the entire process of loading, cleaning, and analyzing the dataset.

Preprocessed data: Explore the CSV files in the Preprocessed data directory if you want to skip the preprocessing steps and work directly with the transformed data.

Report: Refer to the detailed report <code>Energy_consumption_report.md</code> in the Report directory for a comprehensive summary of the analyses and findings.
